# MODULE 1 : Packaging Evolution

In this module we learnt the Packaging of Chips from basic SOT to Advanced 2.5D/3D Packaging. The Chips are fabricated on Wafer after this we cannot use the die directly in real world. In real world when an product is created there involves multiple chips communicating with each other on PCB. Protection of semiconductor devices on die(e.g. Corrosion, moisture and physical damage). As an example shown in the video lecture below image.

## Product Requirements 

The Package depends on following factors : 
1. Application
2. Form factor
3. Reliability and Durability
4. Cost
5. Thermal Dissipation
6. Pin Count (I/O pins)

The Package structure is composed of Mold compound, die, Carrier and System Board(PCB). In below image we can see the sandwich of the components on top of each other.

### Packages Available 
There are various packages available following are different types : 
1. Through-hole Mounting : 
  - DIP : Dual In-line package
  - TO  : Through Hole
  - PGA : Plastic Grid Array
    
2. Surface Mount Technology (SMT) :
   - QFN    : Quad Flat No Lead
   - QFP    : Quad Flat Package
   - CSP    : Chip Scale Package
   - PBGA   : Plastic Ball Grid Array
   - LGA    : Land Grid Array
   - PoP    : Package on Package
   - MCM    : Multi-Chip Module
   - CoWoS  : Chip on Wafer on Substrate.

The CoWoS latest technology where multiple dies side-by-side interposer enabling 2.5D and 3D stacking. This is used for meeting high performance and efficiency. It provides TSVs and micro-bumps for interconnects, reducing power consumption and improving signal integrity.

## Anatomy of Packages
In below screenshot we can see the Leadframe, BGA and Advanced package anatomy.

In Leadframe-CSP, QFN, QFP the internal structure how the die I/O ports are connected to external I/O pins using gold wire. 

In the PBGA and BGA the package substrate is present in b/w the die and external I/O balls. 

In Advanced packages substrates we have RDL, Interposer (Si, Organic) for connecting multipl die in 2D, 2.1D, 2.3D and 2.5D. The Advanced and latest 2.5D is CoWoS.

### Comparison
Based on the application we choose the IC packages. As an example in below sceenshot we can see listed applications based on different IC package type.

# MODULE 2 : Wafer to Package: Assmebly and Manfacturing Essentials 

The Supply Chain is composed of following steps : 

1. Design House
2. Wafer Fabrication.
3. Package Assembly and Test.
4. Board Assembly and Test.
5. Product Assembly and Test.
